# tic-tac-toe
Implementation of a game of TicTacToe running in the browser, using only vanilla JavaScript and without importing external libraries. 
The app has the following features:
- 3x3 playing grid
- An indication of who is currently playing (Player 1 or Player 2)
- A reset/restart button to reset the grid and restart playing at any time
- When a player wins, the cells containing the winning streak are highlighted and the game stops - no further interactions with the grid is possible. You can only start a new game.Â 
- After a game ends, it offers the possibility to "review" the game. There are additional controls that allow going back and forward in time, in order to show all moves done by the players from the beginning of the game till the end.
